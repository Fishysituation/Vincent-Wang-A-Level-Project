    \section{Networks}
        Testing the networks was difficult as there was no idea how a well-trained network "should" act on given data as the forex market is stochastic. We can however just try to evaluate the

        \section{Analysis of Behaviour on Unseen data}
        For each of the networks above, graphs are shown below of the actual price in a given timestep versus the. 4 types of unseen data were used - real historic data, straight line positive gradient, straight line negative gradient and a sine wave. For the first, the results will be discussed as it is a more ambiguous test that the other three.
